I want to show you a step-by-step example of how to create the form and the catalog page using the Custom Tables.

Let's create the "Appointments" form page as an example.

This form will have the following fields: Full Name, Email, and Date.

We will also have a Catalog View page to see the list of submitted appointment applications.

Additionally, the website will send a notification email to the owner of the website.

The first thing to do is to create a new table. Next, we need to add fields to our table.

Then we create the Form, Catalog, and Email Layout.

And the last thing is to create the Menu Items to make the form and the catalog visible on the website.

# Example:
**The submit form:**

**The Catalog Page:**

# Step by step guide
## Step 1: Creating a new Table

To Create New Custom Table, go to Components / Custom Tables. Click on the Tables section icon.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/2.png)

Then click on the [New] button.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/3.png)

Fill in the form. "Unique Table Name" is how the table will be identified in the system.
"Table Title" is the translatable name of the table that will be visible to front-end users, if set so.

If you have a multilingual website, then more "Table Title" fields will appear - one per each language.
The "Category" field is to organize tables.

You can also add a description to your table- it will also be visible to front-end user, if set so.

When done - click "Save and Close".

## Step 2: Adding fields to our table

Now we have an empty table. Click on the Fields (0) link to manage the Table Fields.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/6.png)

Click on [New] button to create new field. Fill up the form and click Save.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/7.png)

Create a "fullname" field. Fill in the form. Save it and create more fields.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/8.png)

Create "email" field.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/9.png)

Create "date" field.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/10.png)

You can set additional options if needed.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/11.png)

Now, we have three fields.

## Step 3: Creating output Layouts

The Layout is the way in which the parts of Custom Table are arranged on rendered HTML page.

In Custom Tables we use special "tags" that will be replaced with the content from the database or generated by the process.
Example: [table:title] - That would be replaced with current table title - "Appointments"

### The First Layout:
Let's move on and create our first Layout.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/m.png)

Click on the [New] button to create new Layout.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/14.png)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/laytout2.png)7

Enter the Layout name "SubmitAppointments", that will be the unique name of our layout since it will be used as the identifier name to find the Layout.

Select the Type: Type on what kind of page it will be used. We need a layout for Submit Form page so select "Edit Form" type.

Select the table to which attach the layout to.

Now you may use "Layout Auto Creator" too to generate the layout based on the type and fields your current Custom Table has.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/laytout3.png)

Most of the Tags have their parameters. For example, the html.button("save&close") has the parameters "type", "Button Label", "Custom Redirect Link" Ans "CSS class".

Simply double-click on a Tag to see what parameters it has.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/t.png)

In the "Custom Redirect Link" you can add a link to redirect the person to the Home Page.

When you finish editing the Layout - Save it.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/z.png)

Now we have an Edit Form Layout. 

### The Second Layout:

Now we need a Catalog Layout. A Catalog Layout is a form of table data output to show submitted records.

Click on [New] to create new Layout, enter Layout Name "List of Appointments" for example.

Select Type - "Simple Catalog". This type of layout allows to render HTML Table output using {catalogtable:} tag.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/new1.png)

Click on "Layout Auto Creator" too to generate the Simple Catalog layout.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/form6.png)

Click on {{html.toolbar} which is on the line 30, to personalize the buttons you want to have there. When you finish - Click on "Save and Close".

### The Third Layout:

Also Create an "Email Layout" - It will be send to an email provided in Menu Item (Will be explained later) after form submission.

## Step 4: Adding a Menu Item

Now let's setup the front-end. We will use Menu Items to create front-end pages.

First create a new Menu Item, enter the Menu Title.

Select Menu Item Type. We need Custom Tables - Add New Item (This is submit Form page)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/21.png)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/untitled.png)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/25.png)

Go to Settings, Select your Table and set "Who may add content" to Public - to let unregistered users submit their form.
The rest set to Administrator or Super Administrator.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/141.png)

Select "Guests Can Add New Records"

Set "Send Email when record" to "Added"

To "On Record Add Send Email to" type the email address where do you want an email to be sent to.

Also, Select Email Layout. Save it.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/142.png)

Now it's time to see how it looks in-front end. Open in front-end the menu item you just created. It should look like this:

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/Z2-Copy.png)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/again2.png)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/again3.png)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/again4.png)

You will receive an email after submitting this form.

Try to change/add various parameters Layout to familiarize yourself.

To view submitted records we have "ListOfAppointments" layout. Create a menu item with Custom Tables/Catalog type to have it in front-end.

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/23.png)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/aca2.png)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/aca3.png)

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/aca4.png)

Set who may view this Menu Item

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/finish1.png)

### This is what you will have in a front-end of your website:

![](https://joomlaboat.com/images/components/ct/ctquickstart/1-Copy.png)

By default the new table comes with just two fields: "id" (int(10)) where unique record ID stored, and "published" (tinyint(1)) which will mark a record as published/visible (1) or unpublished/hidden (0).
These two fields cannot be changed or deleted.
