Custom Tables for Joomla is an extension that allows you to add custom database tables, fields and layouts.

It has different layouts (templates): catalogs, edit form or details page etc. And it fully support modern template language Twig.

It has 40 Field Types like Integer, Decimal, Text String, Date, Time, Email, Color, Image, File, Table Join, User, Language, etc. Edit Form Input boxes depend on the field type, Date field type will show a calendar, Color - Color Picker, Image - Image Uploader, etc.

Tables can be connected using Table Join field type (LEFT JOIN).

Layout Editor with Twig language has an Auto-Create button that will create a new layout based on the list of fields the table has.

Tables are stored in MySQL, Maria or Postgree databases, all queries and field values are sanitized.

The layout is a template language for HTML code with special tags to output data from the table records.

When rendering catalog records, the tag will be replaced with the field value.

Example you have a field "producttitle", to output it's value type this:

`<p>{{ producttitle }}</p>`

Where `<p></p>` is the HTML paragraph tag. and `{{ producttitle }}` is the Twig tag that will return the field "producttitle" value.
